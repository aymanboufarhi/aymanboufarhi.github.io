## Work Experience :
**Machine Learning Intern (_August 2024 - September 2024_)**
- As a Machine Learning Intern, I worked on enhancing an existing property management platform ( mydayf.com ) by implementing a rental price prediction feature using machine learning. I developed the backend with FastAPI to handle API requests and integrated it with a Next.js frontend, ensuring smooth data flow and user interaction. I also applied web scraping techniques to collect real estate data, preprocessed the dataset, and trained a Gradient Boosting model for accurate rental price prediction.

**Game Developer-Internship (_April 2023 - June 2023_)**
- Optimizing the reward system for a serious educational game (GLUPS M123, a multiplication table game) for an enhanced approach to a rewarding learning experience.
- Implementing data acquisition capabilities by recording each player's activity trace in a well-structured CSV file.

**Graphic Designer (_August 2015 - January 2023_)**
- Passionate graphic designer specializing in dynamic football and singer posters. Combining design skills with an understanding of target audiences, I create visually stunning artwork that captures the excitement of matches and the essence of musicians. With expertise in composition, typography, and color, I bring creativity and professionalism to every project. My goal is to evoke emotions, promote events, and engage viewers in the captivating worlds of football and music.

## Projects :
### MyDayf Prediction
[Github Repository](https://github.com/aymanboufarhi/House-Rent-Prediction-Tangier)  
Full-stack application for predicting house rental prices in Tangier, built with Next.js and FastAPI.
As part of a machine learning internship, I developed a rental price prediction system integrated into the MyDayf platform at Tala Space. The project involved scraping real estate data, preprocessing it, and training a predictive model using Gradient Boosting. I built a dynamic front-end using Next.js and integrated it with a FastAPI backend to provide real-time rental price predictions based on user inputs. This project adds value to MyDayf's offering by introducing predictive insights, with ongoing efforts to improve the model's accuracy and performance.


### Animate
[Github Repository](https://github.com/aymanboufarhi/AniMate)  
"Animate" is an anime recommendation system using KMeans clustering, ReactJS, and FastAPI for personalized suggestions.
During this project, I developed an anime recommendation system named Animate using machine learning techniques like KMeans clustering. The system suggests personalized anime recommendations based on user preferences. I built the front-end using ReactJS for a smooth and interactive user experience, while the back-end was developed with FastAPI to handle data and deliver real-time recommendations.
